                            in your browser again. You might need to force-refresh with
                            Ctrl+Shift-R/Cmd+Shift+R, but you should see a purple site now.
                            The update worked!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now, let's see what happens if you set a long TTL.

                            <li><strong>TTL: </strong> 3000000 (that's 30 days! Or use any reasonably big number)</li>

                        in your browser. You should see an orange website.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Click 'Edit' and change the CNAME record to point at <code>purple.messwithdns.com</code> instead.

                        in your browser again. You should see
                        the same orange site -- no change!
                        This is because your old DNS record is
                        still cached.
                        You might also notice that there are no new requests in the "Requests" section.

                        When the TTL is 30 seconds, the second time you make the request, the
                        cache will have expired so you'll get the new version. Here's what that looks like in detail:

                    <p>
                        And when the TTL is a big number like 10 days, the cache never expires, so you can't get the updated site. Here's what that looks like:

                            When your browser requests a website, it
                            sends a <code>Host</code> header with the name of the domain you typed in.
                            If the server (like Apache/nginx) doesn't recognize that name, it'll often
                            return a 404. Here's more detail about how that works.
                        </p>

                        When you request example.com and everything works, here's what happens:
                        </p>

                            <li class="browser">Browser asks: where's example.com?</li>
                            <li class="resolver">Resolver responds: 93.184.216.34</li>
                            <li class="browser">Browser (to 93.184.216.34): an HTTP request for <code>Host: example.com</code>!</li>

                        <p>
                            But when you request bad-ip.{{domain}}.messwithdns.com and you get a 404, here's how it goes:

                        We need a reasonably long TTL because the resolvers need to cache the IP for at least the length of this experiment.

                    <li>
                        Now, let's ask all 3 providers what they think our IP address is. Here's what I see:

                        <pre>
$ dig +noall +answer @8.8.8.8 3-ips.{{domain}}.messwithdns.com

bad-ip.ionized-twig.messwithdns.com. 30	IN A	30.31.32.33
</pre>
                        All of the 3 DNS servers have different opinion about what our IP address is! Mischief managed.

                        makes a request for it. And because you're literally the only person in the

                    8.8.8.8 isn't one server, it's many DNS servers. What
                    probably happened is that when you queried 8.8.8.8 the first
                    time, you missed some of its servers. And then at the end,
                    you reached a new server that hadn't cached the record yet.
                    (this is why it says "query 10 times", but sometimes 10
                    times isn't enough)

                Lots of domains have multiple IP addresses associated with them.
                Usually you don't notice because the two IP addresses serve the exact
                same webpage. But we can see more easily how this works by using two IPs which are totally different websites.
                <ul class="steps">
                    <li> Create 2 records that point to different webpages (one orange and one purple) </li>
                    <li> Use curl to repeatedly request the same domain, and see what happens!</li>

                    <li>
                        Create an A record with:
                        <ul class="record-expl">
                            <li><strong>Name:</strong> conflict <br> </li>
                            <li><strong>IPv4 Address:</strong> <code>213.188.218.160</code> <br> </li>
                            <li><strong>TTL:</strong> 5</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> Create another A record with:
                        <ul class="record-expl">
                            <li><strong>Name:</strong> conflict <br> </li>
                            <li><strong>IPv4 Address:</strong> <code>213.188.209.192</code> <br> </li>

                    <li>
                        In your terminal, run
                        <pre>curl http://conflict.{{currDomain()}}.messwithdns.com 2&gt;/dev/null | grep title </pre>
                        10 times.
                        When I run it, the result I get changes back and forth between 'orange' and 'purple', like this. You might see different behaviour though, which we'll talk about in the explanation :)
                        <pre>
$ curl http://conflict.{{currDomain()}}.messwithdns.com/ 2&gt; /dev/null | grep title
&lt;title&gt;orange&lt;/title&gt;
$ curl http://conflict.{{currDomain()}}.messwithdns.com/ 2&gt; /dev/null | grep title
&lt;title&gt;purple&lt;/title&gt;
$ curl http://conflict.{{currDomain()}}.messwithdns.com/ 2&gt; /dev/null | grep title
&lt;title&gt;orange&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;title&gt;orange&lt;/title&gt;
$ curl http://conflict.{{currDomain()}}.messwithdns.com/ 2&gt; /dev/null | grep title
&lt;title&gt;purple&lt;/title&gt;

                        The weird thing about this experiment is actually that I've seen 3
                        different results from different people I've tested it with, even though
                        everyone was using the same version of curl. So, why do different people see
                        different behaviour? Let's start by thinking about what happens when you run <code>curl</code>.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="explanation-list">
                        <li class="you    "> You create 2 records </li>
                        <li class="you"> You run <code>curl conflict.{{domain}}.messwithdns.com</code></li>
                        <li class="you"> You run <code>curl conflict.{{domain}}.messwithdns.com</code> again, it gets sent to your resolver</li>
                        <li class="resolver">Resolver has the 2 records cached, and returns them</li>
                    </ul>

                    Your resolver now has 2 records, and it needs to decide what order to return them in. It might do any of:
                    <ul class="normal-list">
                        <li>Return the records in the same order it received them</li>
                        <li>Change the order every time it receives a request (this is what mine does!)</li>
                        <li>Pick an order at random</li>
                        <li>Maybe do something else that I haven't listed here! I don't know!</li>
                    </ul>

                    curl will then pick the first record returned, but which one that is depends on the order that the resolver picked.
