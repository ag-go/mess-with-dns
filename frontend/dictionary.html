        <p class="my-4"> Here are a few quick definitions to get you started: </p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td class="word">A record</td>
                <td>A very common type of DNS record. It contains an IPv4 address, like <code>1.2.3.4</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="word">Authoritative DNS server</td>
                <td>
                    This is one type of DNS server. Every domain has an
                    authoritative DNS server assigned to it.
                    The way DNS requests generally flow is:
<pre>you -&gt; DNS resolver -&gt; authoritative
                         DNS server
</pre>
            </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="word">CNAME record</td>
                <td>
                    A common type of DNS record. It contains an hostname
                    address, like <code>example.com</code>. <a href="https://wizardzines.com/comics/cname">CNAME records comic</a>.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="word">DNS name</td>
                <td>
                    Every time you type a domain, subdomain, or sub-sub-domain into your browser, that's a DNS name!
                    A DNS name (like <code>bananas.prince.fruit.oops.pie.com.</code>) has to:
                    <ul>
                        <li> be less than 255 characters</li>
                        <li> have less than 63 "<code>.</code>"s in it</li>
                        <li> be composed of only a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and "-" characters</li>
                        <li> and a couple of other rules </li>
                    </ul>
                    Other than that, DNS queries can contain any DNS name.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="word">DNS record</td>
                <td>
                    When you make a DNS query, you get 0 or more records in response. Every record has at least 4 fields: the <strong>name</strong>, the <strong>TTL</strong>, the <strong>type</strong>, and one or more <strong>content</strong> fields. For example the IP address in an A record is its content.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="word">DNS resolver</td>
                <td>This is one type of DNS server. A resolver takes your request, sends it to the right authoritative DNS server, and caches the result. You might be using a resolver run by Google, Cloudflare, or your ISP. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="word">DNS query</td>
                <td>
                    A DNS query is a request that you send to a DNS server. It contains 2 fields: the name (like example.com), and the type (like "A").
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="word">TTL</td>
                <td>Stands for <strong>Time To Live</strong>.  This is a DNS record field. It's an number of seconds. DNS resolvers use it to decide how long to cache the record.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
