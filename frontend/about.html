        <h1 class="text-3xl mt-8 mb-8 text-center">About</h1>
        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-8 mb-8">Why did you build this?</h2>

        <p>
        Well, I was writing a <a href="https://wizardzines.com">zine</a> about DNS. And at the end of
        many of my zines, I say "the best way to learn is to experiment!  Do
        weird DNS experiments and see how it works". But I realized that most
        people, even if they have a domain, probably aren't comfortable doing
        weird DNS experiments on a domain that's important to
        them.
        </p>
        <p>
        So I figured I'd create a domain that's just for playing around
        (<code>messwithdns.com</code>) and let anyone set DNS records on it.
        You're very encouraged to play around and break things.
        </p>


        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-8 mb-8">FAQ</h2>

        <h3>I found a bug!</h3>
        <p>
        I'd love to hear about it! You can report issues with the site <a href="https://github.com/jvns/mess-with-dns-backend/issues">on GitHub</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>What's the difference between messwithdns.net and messwithdns.com?</h3>
        <p>
        The <code>.com</code> version is for serving the website, the
        <code>.net</code> version is where you're allowed to set DNS records.
        They're separate because it makes the site faster, more secure, and
        more reliable (I can use a "real" DNS server for messwithdns.net).
        </p>

        <h3>Does Mess With DNS support setting all DNS record types?</h3>

        <p>
        Technically the API does allow setting any DNS record type you want,
        but I've only built the UI for a few types. In particular I haven't set
        up DNSSEC yet so there's no UI for setting DNSSEC records.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I get any subdomain I want?</h3>
        <p>
        No, you can only get a randomly generated subdomain, like <code>banana17.messwithdns.com</code>.
        </p>

        <h3>Should I use this for my actual website?</h3>
        <p>
        <strong>No</strong>, your DNS records get deleted after a week. This is to save disk space and to discourage anyone from relying on
        this for anything real. It's just for learning.
        </p>
