        <h2 class="text-2xl mt-8 mb-8">Why did you build this?</h1>

        <p>
        This site exists because I (Julia) was writing a zine about DNS. At the
        end of many of my zines, I say "the best way to learn is to experiment!
        Do weird DNS experiments and see how it works". But I realized that
        most people, even if they have a domain, probably aren't comfortalbe
        doing weird DNS experiments on a domain that's important to
        them.
        </p>
        <p>
        So I figured I'd create a domain that's just for playing around
        (<code>messwithdns.com</code>) and let anyone set DNS records on it.
        </p>

        <p>
        This project was built by <a href="https://jvns.ca">Julia Evans</a> and 
        <a href="https://marieflanagan.com/">Marie Claire LeBlanc Flanagan</a>.
        </p>

        <h1 class="text-2xl mt-8 mb-8">How does it work?</h1>

        Here are a few notes on how Mess With DNS is implemented, in question/answer form.

        <h3>How do you parse DNS queries?</h3>
        <p>
        It's written in Go and it uses the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/miekg/dns">github.com/miekg/dns</a>
        library for all if its DNS query parsing and for formatting the replies.
        </p>

        <h3>Will my records get deleted?</h3>
        <p>
        Yes, records get deleted after a week. This is to heavily discourage
        anyone from relying on this for anything real. It's just for learning.
        </p>

        <h3>Where are the records stored?</h3>
        <p>
        They're in a small PostgreSQL database. It contains the records and
        every DNS response that's it's served in the last 24 hours.
        </p>

        <h3>What's the difference between messwithdns.com and messwithdns.com?</h3>
        <p>
        The <code>.com</code> version is for serving the website, the
        <code>.net</code> version is where you're allowed to set DNS records.
        They're separate because it makes the site faster, more secure, and
        more reliable (I can use a "real" DNS server for messwithdns.com).
        </p>

        <h3>Does it really support setting all DNS record types</h3>

        <p>
        Technically the API does allow setting any DNS record type you want,
        but I've only built the UI for a few types. In particular I haven't set
        up DNSSEC yet so there's no UI for setting DNSSEC records.
        </p>

        <h3>Can I get any subdomain I want?</h3>
        <p>
        No, I got worried about phishing so you can only get a randomly generated subdomain, like <code>banana17</code>
        </p>
